# Smart-Garbage-Monitoring-System
## Project Summary
The Smart Garbage Monitoring System uses IoT technology to tackle urban waste management challenges. Ultrasonic sensors, connected to a NodeMCU microcontroller, measure garbage levels in real-time. When a bin is full, an alert is sent to municipal authorities via a web server for immediate collection. An Android app and web interface provide remote monitoring, enhancing efficiency and reducing manual oversight. This system aims to improve city cleanliness, optimise waste collection, and promote public health.

## Motivation
Waste management is a growing challenge, especially in rapidly urbanizing regions like India. Overflowing garbage bins not only mar the aesthetics of public spaces but also pose severe health risks by fostering the spread of diseases and contributing to environmental pollution. Despite efforts to improve waste management, the lack of real-time monitoring and timely waste collection remains a significant issue.
The motivation behind the Smart Garbage Monitoring System stems from the need to address these challenges through innovative technology. By leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT), this project aims to provide a smart, efficient solution to waste management that reduces the reliance on manual monitoring and ensures that garbage is collected promptly before it becomes a hazard.
This system empowers municipal authorities with real-time data, allowing them to optimize waste collection routes and schedules, reducing operational costs and environmental impact. Additionally, it encourages a cleaner and healthier urban environment, contributing to broader public health and sustainability goals.
The ultimate goal of this project is to create a scalable solution that can be implemented across various cities, enhancing urban living conditions and setting a precedent for smart city initiatives worldwide.

## Project Details
### Components

- **Hardware**
**_Ultrasonic Sensor:_** Measures the distance to the waste level in the bin, providing real-time data on garbage levels.<br />
**_NodeMCU (ESP8266):_** A low-cost microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi, processes sensor data and sends it to the web server. The ESP-12E variant is used for its robust features and low power consumption.<br />
**_Arduino MKR1000:_** Acts as the central processing unit, handling communication between the ultrasonic sensor and the Wi-Fi module.<br />
**_Plastic Container:_** Houses all components, providing a durable and waterproof enclosure.<br />
**_Battery Pack:_** Powers the system, typically using AA batteries or a similar power source.

- **Software**
**_Blynk App:_** Provides a user-friendly interface to visualize and control the garbage monitoring system. Allows real-time tracking and management via a mobile device.<br />
**_Custom Web Interface:_** Displays real-time data on garbage levels, sends alerts for collection, and helps optimize waste collection routes.<br />
**_Arduino IDE:_** Used for programming the Arduino MKR1000 and NodeMCU. It includes necessary libraries for sensor integration and data transmission.

### Technical Details
**_Ultrasonic Sensor:_** Positioned inside the bin lid to measure the distance to the trash, with data used to determine if the bin is full (75% threshold) or needs attention (below 25% threshold).<br />
**_NodeMCU (ESP8266):_** Handles Wi-Fi connectivity and data transmission. Features a 32-bit processor, multiple GPIO pins, and low power consumption modes.<br />
**_Arduino MKR1000:_** Interfaces with the NodeMCU and ultrasonic sensor, processes sensor data, and sends alerts when bins are full.<br />
**_Blynk Platform:_** Facilitates remote monitoring and control through customizable widgets and real-time data visualization.

### Functionality
**_Real-Time Monitoring:_** The ultrasonic sensor provides continuous updates on garbage levels, which are sent to the NodeMCU and displayed on the Blynk app.<br />
**_Alerts and Optimization:_** When a bin reaches the full threshold, alerts are sent to municipal authorities via the web interface and mobile app. This data helps optimize waste collection schedules and routes.<br />
**_User Interface:_** The Blynk app and custom web interface offer intuitive visualization of garbage levels, enhancing decision-making and operational efficiency.
